                The corrosion rates of submerged or buried metals can be controlled by both cathodic and anodic protection. Cathodic protection is the most commonly used of these two methods, and it is widely used on carbon-steel structures as well as on other structural metals. Anodic protection is used on occasion in the chemical-process and mining industries where extremely aggressive environments are encountered. Anodic protection is most commonly applied to stainless steels and other corrosion-resistant metals which need additional corrosion resistance in certain environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both systems require immersion in an electrolyte, usually water or, in the case of cathodic protection, wet soil or wet concrete.
            </p>

            <h2>Cathodic protection</h2>
            <p>
                Cathodic protection is an electrical means of corrosion control where the structure to be protected is made into a cathode in an electrochemical cell. Oxidation in the electrochemical cell is concentrated on the anodes leaving the structure protected as a cathode with a net reduction reaction. Properly designed cathodic protection systems can reduce the corrosion rate to negligible amounts.
            </p>

            <p>
                As it will be described in detail below, there are two kinds of cathodic protection: sacrificial-anode cathodic protection and impressed-current cathodic protection. The sacrificial version operates as a galvanic cell, the structure to be protected is connected to a metal anode of higher electrochemical activity which will dissolve to protect the structure (the cathode of the cell). The impressed-current version operates like an electrolytic cell, where an external power source is used to cathodically polarize the structure to be protected.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common structures to be cathodically protected are pipelines. The principles of cathodic protection are the same for all structures, so lessons learned on pipelines have been applied to many other structures. Cathodic protection is usually applied to carbon-steel and cast-iron structures, but is has also been used successfully on a variety of other metals. NACE SP0169 contains guidance on these other metals as well as on steel structures.

                Figure 1 shows a simple sacrificial cathodic protection system for a buried pipeline. The pipeline is connected by a lead wire to a buried magnesium anode which corrodes at an accelerated rate thereby providing protective cathodic current to the pipeline. The picture emphasizes the following ideas associated with cathodic protection:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>cathodic protection is an <b>electrical</b> means of corrosion control</li>
                <li>the protected structure becomes the <b>cathode</b> in an electrochemical cell</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The picture does not emphasize the following ideas that are also true for most, but not all, cathodic protection systems:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>protective coatings are the <b>primary</b> means of corrosion control in this pipeline</li>
                <li>cathodic protection, acting as a secondary means of corrosion control, is sized to provide the necessary protective current where coating holidays (defects) do not provide corrosion protection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Industry has found over the years that a combination of protective coatings and supplemental (secondary) cathodic protection is the most economical means of corrosion control for buried pipelines and for many similar structures. The protective coating (which is an electrical insulator) is never 100% reliable and needs to be supplemented. The presence of the coating reduces the electrical current demand and saves electricity, which means the cathodic protection system can be smaller than if no protective coating were used.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some structures have cathodic protection with no protective coatings. Examples include the submerged portions of conventional offshore oil- or gas-production platforms and many kinds of process equipment.
            </p>

            <h3>How cathodic protection works</h3>
            <p>
                Cathodic protection was first suggested in 1824 by Humphry Davy (a famous English scientist) for use on British naval vessels. R. Kuhn and coworkers (1933) in coastal Louisiana are generally credited with introducing cathodic protection to the corrosion control of buried structures. The idea remained controversial for decades, but Kuhn and others emphasized that reduced leak records justified its use.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Evans diagrams in Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the principles of cathodic protection. The intersection of the oxidation and the reduction reactions determines the unprotected corrosion rate. Once cathodic protection is applied, the corrosion current is greatly reduced. In Figure 3 the corrosion rate is reduced over two orders of magnitude (to less than 1/100th of the unprotected corrosion rate). Note that the potential of the cathodically-protected iron in this figure (-0.85 V against saturated copper/copper sulfate reference electrode) is above the equilibrium potential and that the corrosion rate, while reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, is not zero.
